### Hi there, I'm Idriss Ait hafid ðŸ‘‹

Ever since writing my first web application, I have been obsessed with the power of software to solve real problems. So, it was the time I decided to dive more into software engineering. Analyzing, designing, content writing, coding, profiling, testing, and reviewing are some of the many steps for product development I am doing every day for the last 3 years.

I'm a full-stack software developer. I've done end-to-end web development using many different front-end and back-end technologies, mobile development, and more. I have a passion for discovering whatâ€™s new in the technical world, which helps me quickly find solutions and tools I need to get my job done.

For my first professional experience, I was given the opportunity to lead and be responsible for the full processes of building an IoT platform, being part of an e-learning platform.

Even when I leave the office, I tend to continue writing code and learning new stuff.
So today I am a software engineer having what it takes to build powerful solutions.


Skills: JavaScript, Node, React.

Interests: Data Science, Distributed Systems, Web Development, New Technologies.
